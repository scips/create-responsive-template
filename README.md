# This fork is a proposal to move to tools/build.js part of the build process hardcoded in volofile

To use it

    > volo create myproject scips/create-responsive-template
    > cd myproject

Then install node dependencies from package.json

    > npm install

Then everything is similar to [volojs/create-responsive-template](https://github.com/volojs/create-responsive-template)
